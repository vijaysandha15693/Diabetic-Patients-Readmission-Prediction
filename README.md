# Diabetic-Patients-Readmission-Prediction

Executive Summary:Diabetes, a medical condition characterized by insufficient insulin production in Type-1 diabetes and insulin resistance in Type-2 diabetes, is highly prevalent among the population. Hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients pose a significant concern in the United States, with healthcare costs exceeding $250 million in 2011. Diabetes, being a chronic condition with no specific cure, necessitates effective management.

Objective: Hospital readmission rates have become a key indicator of healthcare quality and cost-effectiveness. Excessive readmissions can result in financial penalties for hospitals, highlighting deficiencies in the healthcare system. Thus, it is imperative for hospitals to prioritize reducing readmission rates. The aim of this study is to identify the critical factors influencing diabetes-related readmissions and predict the likelihood of patient readmission.

Approach: The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the UCI website, encompassing a decade of patient data from 130 hospitals. Python is employed for data analysis, utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib. Various machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree,Multilayer Perceptron ,Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are applied for classification and regression tasks to achieve the study's objectives.
